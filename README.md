This is my [notebook](https://github.com/Hazem09/DataCamp-Certification/blob/2bee152a23ce7eb807c3c594d458e3d2c2f724ba/notebook.ipynb) for passing [the DataCamp Data ScientistÂ Professional Certification exam](https://app.datacamp.com/certification/get-started/data-scientist/professional/overview) on [August 22nd,2023](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DS0028985118689).

The [Data](https://github.com/Hazem09/DataCamp-Certification/blob/2bee152a23ce7eb807c3c594d458e3d2c2f724ba/recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv) *.csv* and data [description](https://github.com/Hazem09/DataCamp-Certification/blob/2bee152a23ce7eb807c3c594d458e3d2c2f724ba/Practical%20-%20DSP%20-%20Recipe%20Site%20Traffic-2212.pdf) and goals *.PDF* are both provided in the repo.

I used **Decision Random Forest Classifier** and **KNN** models to predict if a recipe will generate high traffic if it was published on the front page of the website.

More details are available in the notebook for the steps I took in my analysis and modeling.
